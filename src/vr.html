                    A selected group of students at ESDi has worked on the design of an adapted Segway-like vehicle
                    that would allow humans to travel around interior spaces in Mars carrying an HP's HTC Vive
                    backpack station with a VR workstation environment that students have also designed to allow
                    humans to work remotely in Mars.
                </p>
                <p class="is-size-3" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    The red planet presents extremely different climatic and environmental conditions than planet Earth.
                    In order to be able to save resources and psace in Mars, humans will have to work remotely using a
                    virtualized workspace inspired by current working places on Earth. <br>
                    The adapted Segway vehicle has been designed with a special case that will allow users to stop the
                    vehicle in any indoor space, seat comfortably and use the VR workstation. Two integrated sensors
                    will allow the VR headset to geo-localize the users so that they can move within the virtual space.
                    The vehicle design also integrates storage space and lighting. We imagine that these adapted
                    Segways could be available in any indoor space in Mars for people to take, use and drop off at
                    designated spots, a sort of Citybike-Office in Mars.

                    Moreover, the virtualization of the traditional office space offered an oppportunity for students to re-
                    think current workspaces and to design the tools and features that the working spaces of the future
                    should have considering the opportunities that VR has to offer.
                </p>
                <p class="is-size-3" style="margin: 2rem 0;">
                    The team of students and professors at ESDi Design School conducted research on how people
                    interact with physical elements in their working environments as well as on how they interact with
                    coworkers and clients at the office. That information was used to design the virtual working
                    environment presented in this proposal, which includes improvements over current (real) office
                    spaces such as: speech to text translation, 360ยบ video meetings, 360ยบ canvases, 3D skething, smart
                    calendar and to-does apps, and a three-dimension re-design of the traditional computer interface.
                </p>
                <p class="is-size-3" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    The proposed virtual workspace represents a starting point, we look forward to developing it further
                    in the following development phase. For example, in its final form, the VR workspace would be
                    completely customizable by users. They would be able to choose different materials to decorate their
                    virtual offices, they could design or buy objects of their choice or pick the view that thy would like to
                    have from their VR office window.
                </p>
                <p class="is-size-3" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    As a starting point, we have designed a neutral room based in the concept of "harborage". Assuming
                    that in the barren landscape of Mars humans will miss the comfort of home, students built the
                    working environment with warm materials such as wood and velvet. Likewise, the use of oval shapes
                    in the design of the objects that inhabit the VR workspace aim to recall the idea of planet, orbit, and
                    cosmos and remind us that the user is at the center of the environment and tools and space are
                    around it.
                </p>
                <p class="is-size-3" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    Besides designing the virtual office space, students have worked from the user experience point of
                    view designing the interaction with the objects in the virtual workspace of the future in Mars. There
                    has been a re-design of current common office tools at three different levels of relevance according
                    to the activities that the user does within the environment. 
                </p>
                <p class="is-size-3" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    At level one, the first thing users will see when they put the VR goggles on, will be a floating
                    surrounding mesh-looking desk with apps on it: a to does list, an agenda, a communication device, a
                    browser, and a tool box. <br>    
                    At level two, to the user's right, there will be a bookshelf, which will be a library containing custom
                    visual and written media that users will have requested quick access to. <br>
                    At a third level, they will find lighting and settings' control knobs as well as the trashcan, in the ceiling
                    and in the floor respectively.
                </p>
                <p class="is-size-3" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    Users will be able to move apps around and, at any given point, they will be able to make apps fill the
                    360ยบ screen. That is, if users need to play a video from the library, they will be able to play it in full
                    screen mode, maximizing the visualization capabilities of HTC Vive.
                </p>
                <p class="is-size-3" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    Users will also be able to see, as they get into their VR workspace, who else is online and
                    communicate with their coworkers using the communication device, which will include text, voice,
                    email, camera and a virtual conference room.
                </p>
                <p class="is-size-3" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    Last but not least, the proposed VR workspace will have a time-machine feature so that users will be
                    able to travel to see past and future states of their office. For example, if they remember they left a
                    to-do note on their VR "desks" a week ago and they cannot fin it, they will be able to travel back to
                    see the state in which the office was left that day.
                </p>
                <p class="is-size-3" style="margin-top: 2rem;">
                    The interaction with all these applications and with the space will be through carefully thought
                    gestures and voice inputs, which students already designed and are to be developed in the next
                    phase of the project.
                    The current proposal includes renderings and a first basic 3D modeling of both the adapted-for-working-anywhere
                    vehicle and the VR workstation environment. We very look forward to adding
                    interaction elements and full functinality to these prototypes in the following development phase.
